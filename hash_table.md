# Hash table
A hash table is a data structure that allows quick storage and lookup of some value `v` using a key `k`. Inserting, reading, deleting has a constant time complexity of `O(1)`. Hash tables are arrays that are indexed by a _hash_ function of a key. A hash function is some function that will consistently transform a key string into some index. 
```
insert(k, v)
get(k)
delete(k)
```
